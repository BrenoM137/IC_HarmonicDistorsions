# Harmonic Flow Calculation and Power Quality Analysis Software

This repository contains the development of a software tool designed for analyzing and calculating the sharing of responsibilities for harmonic distortions and analyzing harmonic flows, with the objective to lay the groundwork for studying and analyzing harmonic responsibility sharing among different agents and consumers. This project was developed as part of my scientific initiation under the guidance of Professor Andréia Crico dos Santos at IFTM (Instituto Federal do Triângulo Mineiro) in Brazil, Uberaba.

### Usage

1. **Prerequisites:** Python 3.12.5 (latest) and math related libraries.
2. **Installation:** Clone this repository and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Execution:** Use the scripts in the `main.py` file to calculate power and harmonic flow. Refer to the README within that directory for specific usage details.
