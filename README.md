# Harmonic Flow Calculation and Power Quality Analysis Software

This repository contains the development of a software tool designed for analyzing and calculating harmonic flows and potential distortions in electrical systems. The project is divided into two distinct phases, each with specific objectives and advancements, but both focusing on power quality and harmonic distortion management.

##Development of a Program for Harmonic Flow Calculation

### Description

The first phase of the project focused on creating a software tool for calculating power flow and harmonic flow in electrical networks. The motivation for this phase was the increase in harmonic distortions due to the growing use of nonlinear devices in modern electrical grids.

**Objectives:**

- Implement harmonic flow calculation to provide a comprehensive analysis of operation in both fundamental and harmonic frequencies.
- Lay the groundwork for studying and analyzing harmonic responsibility sharing among different agents and consumers.

### Usage

1. **Prerequisites:** Python 3.12.5 (latest) and math related libraries.
2. **Installation:** Clone this repository and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Execution:** Use the scripts in the `main.py` file to calculate power and harmonic flow. Refer to the README within that directory for specific usage details.
